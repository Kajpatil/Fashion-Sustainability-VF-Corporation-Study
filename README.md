# Fashion-Sustainability-VF-Corporation-Study
The VF Corporation project undertaken by Kajal Patil focused on understanding the purchasing intentions and actions of Gen-Z and Millennials towards sustainable products, particularly in the outdoor apparel segment. Through secondary research involving news articles, academic journals, and company websites, alongside primary research via in-depth interviews and surveys, the project aimed to uncover the needs, preferences, attitudes, and sustainability knowledge of these demographic groups.

Key findings revealed a general ambivalence towards the sustainability efforts of VF brands such as Timberland and The North Face, with many consumers unaware of these brands' sustainability initiatives. Despite this, the research highlighted a significant interest in brand sustainability among consumers, though 63% of respondents admitted never having researched a brand's sustainability efforts.

The project recommended VF Corporation to boldly promote its sustainability credentials on its product previews and brand websites to make sustainable features more accessible and to leverage Instagram's influence on Gen-Z purchasing decisions by engaging in informative live sessions and sustainability highlights. This comprehensive analysis serves as a testament to the importance of transparent communication and active engagement in social media to enhance consumer awareness and appreciation for sustainable practices within the fashion industry.
